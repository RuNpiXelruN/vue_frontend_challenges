# Frontend Challenges

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```

## Points to note:
| Challenge             | Path  |
| :--------------------- | :----- |
| Attribute Picker      | /attribute-picker |
| Ping Pong             | /ping-pong |

I decided to do both challenges within the same Vue app with an attached Vuex store. Whilst obviously over-engineered for the `Ping Pong` challenge, i believe it was a great choice for the `Attribute Picker` challenge.
